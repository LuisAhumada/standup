# standup
Stand up comedians analysis

## INSTRUCTIONS

1). For a simple run, alll you have to do is run the transcript_from_youtube.py file. The csv files in the Results folder already contained the identified laughs.

2). If you really want to run from scratch (not recommended due to all the dependencies needed), you first run the Standup.py file and then you run the transcript_from_youtube.py file. NOTE: Make sure folders Results and AudioFiles are empty before running Standup.py.
